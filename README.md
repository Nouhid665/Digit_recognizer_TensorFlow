ðŸ§  Digit Recognizer with TensorFlow

This project is a Digit Recognizer built using TensorFlow and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

Previously, I created a digit recognizer from scratch using only NumPy and pure mathematics (manual forward pass, backpropagation, etc.). That project helped me deeply understand the math behind neural networks.

Now, Iâ€™ve implemented the same concept with TensorFlow, leveraging its high-level API to make training faster, more efficient, and scalable.

âœ¨ Features

Built with TensorFlow & Keras

Simple ANN architecture (fully connected layers)

Uses the MNIST dataset

Trains much faster compared to my pure NumPy version

ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit learn

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)
